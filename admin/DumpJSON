=head1 SYNOPSIS

This script will dump the majority of possible webservice version 2 lookups in
JSON format. Since it makes actual webservice calls to do this, it's intended
to be run against a static copy of the database (otherwise, the data wouldn't
be consistent with itself).

Each entity type being dumped is outputted to a single file, located under the
path set by --output-dir, at $entity_type/mbdump/$entity_type. This file
contains one JSON document (entity) per line (LF).

Interally, when making the requests to fetch the JSON, all inc parameters are
included except:

 * Those that perform subqueries and return 25 linked entities:
   https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/Development/XML_Web_Service/Version_2#Subqueries

 * 'work-level-rels' on recording and release lookups.

All entity types are dumped with the exception of URLs, since those are
outputted via relationships. In addition, since recordings are outputted in
release lookups, the script only dumps standalone recordings directly.

Caveats:

Releases with more than 500 recordings ignore 'recording-level-rels', and
since those recordings aren't dumped separately, their relationships will
only be included in the target entities' output. As of 2017-04, this affects
~200 releases.

Options:

    --help                      show this help
    --database                  database to use (default: MAINTENANCE)
    --entity                    entity type to dump; can specify multiple of
                                this flag (default: dump all entities)
    --force-update              force-update entities of this type in its
                                json_dump.${entity}_json table; by default,
                                entities are only inserted where they don't
                                exist, and updates are done by the incremental
                                dump only. can specify multiple of this flag
                                (default: no force-updates)
    --output-dir                location where dumps are outputted (default: .)
